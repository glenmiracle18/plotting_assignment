## Background

The most recent ASC23 considered four major systems-based tracks with a view to providing region-focused contributions to inform the global stocktake, among them Cities, urban and rural settlements, infrastructure, and transport.

This assignment focuses specifically on transport (vehicles and fuel efficiency). You will be analyzing a provided dataset to make sense of the data for future AI purposes.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will use the **matplotlib library and seaborn** to create diagrams that visualize the relationship between various features (columns) and interpret the diagrams.

## Steps

1. Access the [starter notebook](INSERT_LINK_HERE) and [data](INSERT_LINK_HERE). Download and upload them to your own drive.
2. Import the necessary libraries (minimum of 4 libraries).
3. Import the data correctly and display a few rows (4 < rows < 11).
4. Create the plots:
   - Plot a histogram
   - Create a heatmap
   (Ensure the output is visible on the notebook)
5. Correctly interpret the diagrams. Include your interpretation in a cell in the notebook as text or a Python comment.
6. Export and submit:
   - PNG files (in a folder)
   - Source code file (notebook)

## Note

This assignment accounts for 16% of your total grade.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correct import and use of libraries
- Proper data import and display
- Creation of required plots (histogram and heatmap)
- Accurate interpretation of diagrams
- Submission of PNG files and source code

Good luck with your project!
